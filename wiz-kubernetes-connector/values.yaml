  # Set this to true if you are using Istio in sidecar mode.
  # When Istio uses sidecars, there are 2 issues when deploying Wiz:
  # 1) The creation and deletion Jobs never complete (due to istio-proxy sidecar)
  # 2) There is a race condition and possible network connectivity failures
  #    when contacting the Wiz backend.
  #
  # When either of this happens, either the installation, upgrade or uninstallation
  # of the charts fail.
  # Setting this to true ensures that the istio-proxy gets a graceful shutdown
  # and mitigates the networking race condition by sleeping before the Job starts.
