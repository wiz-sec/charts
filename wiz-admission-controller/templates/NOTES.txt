For uninstalling the wiz admission controller you need to delete helm hooks resources manually:
1. Delete validating webhook configuration - kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfiguration {{ printf "%s-%s" (include "wiz-admission-controller.fullname" . ) "misconfigurations" }}
2. Delete mutating webhook configuration - kubectl delete mutatingwebhookconfiguration {{ printf "%s-%s" (include "wiz-admission-controller.fullname" . ) "image-integrity" }}

{{- if not .Values.webhook.secret.name }}
3. Delete certificates secret - kubectl delete -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} secret  {{ include "wiz-admission-controller.secretServerCert" . | trim }}
{{- end }}
{{- if eq .Values.opaWebhook.failurePolicy "Fail" }}

WARNING!!!
opaWebhook.failurePolicy is Fail, You need to delete validatingwebhookconfiguration before uninstall, if webhook exists without chart resources you canâ€™t create resources in your cluster!
{{- end }}
