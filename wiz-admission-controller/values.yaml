  # Set this to true if you are using Istio in sidecar mode.
  # When Istio uses sidecars, there are 2 issues when deploying cronJob:
  # 1) The creation and deletion Jobs never complete (due to istio-proxy sidecar)
  # 2) There is a race condition and possible network connectivity failures
  #    when contacting the Wiz backend.
  #
  # When either of this happens, either the installation, upgrade or uninstallation
  # of the charts fail.
  # Setting this to true ensures that the istio-proxy gets a graceful shutdown
  # and mitigates the networking race condition by waiting for the server to run before the Job starts.

  # Wiz Helm Charts process the security contexts
  # in the following order:
  # 1. Pod security context
  #    lowPrivilegePodSecurityPolicy -> podSecurityContext
  # 2. Containers security context
  #    lowPrivilegeSecurityPolicy -> securityContext
  #
  # Populating the following overrides lowPrivilegeSecurityPolicy to your user-supplied values.yaml
  # allows you to customize and override the defaults
  # (useful for e.g. OpenShift installations that automatically
  #  mutate the Pod and use the first UID and first GID from
  #  the allowed range to run the Pod).
